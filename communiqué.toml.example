# The Jabber ID (JID) to log in as.
# jid=""

# Gets the password by executing the given command and reading from its standard
# output. This lets you use a keyring or password manager instead of writing
# your password to a config file.
#
# For example, install libsecret and use the secret-tool command to get a
# password from a keyring such as GNOME keyring:
#
#     # secret-tool store --label='jabber' jabber myjid@example.com
#     password_eval="secret-tool lookup jabber myjid@example.com"
#
# Or to pull your password from a KeePassXC database:
#
#     password_eval="keepassxc-cli show -a Password secrets.kdbx Communication/xmpp.example.com"
#
# The default is empty, which will cause communiqu√© to prompt for a password:
#
#     password_eval=""
#
# You shouldn't put your password in a plaintext config file, but if you must do
# so you can use echo(1):
#
#     password_eval="echo -n password"


# Specifies a file where TLS master secrets will be written in NSS key log
# format. This can be used to allow external programs such as Wireshark to
# decrypt TLS connections. The file will be truncated without a prompt if it
# already exists.
