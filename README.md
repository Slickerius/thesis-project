An experimental instant messaging client written in [Go] for services that
support the [XMPP protocol] (including the public Jabber network).

This is really just a UI and protocol playground and will likely never turn into
a full client.

## Building

To build Communiqué you will need a supported Go version (see the `go.mod`
file).
If an appropriate version of Go is already installed, try running `make`.
